Corruption and Social Media
Does social media polarization increase or decrease corruption in Europe?
ABSTRACT
Internet is one the most recent communication technology invented by humankind, capable of connecting different individuals from all parts of the world. Social media, a by-product, instead, are shaping and modelling society year by year, creating a ‘virtual world’ different from the real one. This paper is trying to assess whether group polarization, an already established social phenomenon, is more prone to happen in more corrupt democracies or not. The results, in the end, show that such might not be the case, and more advanced democracies might be subject to a higher degree of polarization compared to less advanced ones.

The code includes only the advanced approach, namely with RNN through an iterative algorithm to cover the whole dataset (Italian Articles and British Tweets).
